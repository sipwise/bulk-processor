      "message": "that should be significantly more performant as perl can just do internally memcpy(add_to_result, array+0, array+last_ptr)\nso if the elements memory allocation in the source array is within preallocated memory block (or re-fragmented internally as elements added to the array), then the speed is close to O(1), instead of guaranteed O(n) in case of foreach.",
